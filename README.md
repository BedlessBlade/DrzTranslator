This project is made by BedlessBlade and is in VERY early development. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This program is just a
small fun thing I made.
This will probably not
get many updates but,
I will update this with 
a key listener and some
other benefits.

This project allows the user to type like a user on our redstone server, Open Redstone Engineers. The name of this player is Drz so you will see this in the code.

REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3
pynput library

You can install the pynput library by going to the windows search bar, and opening CMD. Once you have CMD (or on linux called terminal) open, you need to type
"pip install pynput" The install should take a bit under a minute depending on your network speed.


INSTRUCTIONS:
First, open the program.
Second, alt tab to minecraft.
Third, go back to the program and type your message.


Note: Since I was lazy for the first version you need to just restart the program to type another sentence, sorry.
